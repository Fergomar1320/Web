## Introduction

Welcome to our BAMX proposal (final name pending). This app is designed with the purpose of enhancing and streamlining the interaction between BAMX and its commercial donators (providers). 

This app intends to help with associated BAMX services, such as the clothing and medicine bank, managing tasks such as donation cargos, shipments, routes, and inventory.

With this app, BAMX will ensure the timely notification, transportation, collection, and management of donations and goods.

This README file provides an overview of the apps features and usage guidelines.

## Mobile App Features
The mobile app is aimed for two types of users: Providers and BAMX volunteers/drivers. Each of these roles has its own dashboard with its own features.

### For Providers

- __Provider Donation Proposals__: With this application, any given provider of any of the markets mentioned above, will be able to generate a donation proposals. The proposal must have vital information such as:
    - The item to donate
    - The amount to donate
    - Expiration date
    - Any additional information

    These proposals structure will ensure accurate donation standards, and will make it easier for the BAMX administrators to decide whether to accept the proposal or not.

    Providers are also able to track the progress of each of their current proposals, notifying them on their status.

- __Scheduled Pick-ups__: Should a given proposal be accepted, providers will recieve a confirmation order stating pick-up date and time details.

- __Donation History__: Providers will be able to see all of their current and past donations on their dashboard, with all of their corresponding details.

### For Volunteers/Drivers

- __Donations to pick-up__: Drivers will be asigned a specific amount of donations to gather for the day (assigned by an administrator). In their dashboard, drivers/volunteers are able to visualize the list of locations they must go to.

- __Pick-up routes__: Drivers will be able to see a possible route to follow in order to get to the next destination based on their current position.

- __Cargo validation__: (?)

## Web Page for BAMX admins
In addition to the mobile app, there will also be a web page aimed for the BAMX administrators. In this web page, BAMX can recieve all the donation proposals from any provider, evaluate them and decide whether they should accept or deny them (depending on aspects such as the expiration date of the product). The BAMX admin will also be able to visualize through the web page the current and future pick-up schedules and a possible route to gather all the corresponding products in an efficient way. However it is up to BAMX wether to follow these routes, or perform their own.
